# muni-realtime 

This is a MVP side project I did recently to learn how to combine d3 with React.
It displays all Muni routes over a map of SF and shows realtime locations of all the vehicles. The locations update every 15 seconds. You can toggle which routes to show/hide using the buttons below the map.

### Running the app locally
- `npm install`
- `npm run setup-maps` (downloads the latest muni bus route data - optional)
- `npm run start` (this should spin up a dev server and open your browser to the demo page)
